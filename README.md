# Twitter bot

This is an experiment of a Twitter bot made with Golang. 

### Project idea

This project is a growth hacking test of creating a Twitter bot and see how far it can go.

The bot do mainly 4 things :

- Tweet about defined topics
- Favorite tweets that are related to those topics
- Follow people that are tweeting about those topics
- Reply nicely to mentions

It's based on the work of the great [clementb](https://github.com/clementb) and made with love.

### Technical details

This project was a way for me to try Golang and see what I can do with it. It uses some external libraries and tools:

- [Anaconda](https://github.com/ChimeraCoder/anaconda): An open source library to access Twitter API
- [Go SQL Driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql): A Golang MySQL driver
- [Go-wit](https://github.com/jsgoecke/go-wit): A Golang API for [wit.ai](https://wit.ai/)
- [goquery](https://github.com/PuerkitoBio/goquery): CSS-selector like DOM parser.

### Test account

Right now, the bot is running on a test account: Please meet [Mich Birdy](https://twitter.com/michbirdy)!

Maybe you already follow him and you don't even know ;) Be nice with him, he's only... a bot!
